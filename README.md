# atlassian-rpm-specs - Build your own rpm packages of Atlassian products

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) is offering some great tools for team collaboration and developers.
The installation can be done from an installer or an archive.

...

Wait, what? From an archive or an installer?
Where can I find packages for Debian or RHEL?

For years there have been issues [asking for rpm support](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSERVER-36902).
As they won't provide such builds others have to. ðŸ¤“

# Disclaimer

Atlassian does not allow public distribution of the software, e.g. as rpm files.
Therefore it is advised to use this repo and the scripts, which do not contain the software itself, only for internal use.
You should not make your builds public!

The scripts and spec files provided are not fully tested and may break your existing installation.
Please keep in mind to test the files before installing on a production anvironment.

# Requirements and usage
